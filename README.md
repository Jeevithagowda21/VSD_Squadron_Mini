VSD Squadron  Mini Internship


VSD Squadron Mini RISC-V development board is a RISC-V development Board.
It contains 32-bit RISC-V core. It has 16KB of flash memory, 2KB SRAM and operates at 24Mhz. 
The board has 15 GPIO pins and communication protocols such as I2C, SPI, and USART.


TASK-1
1. C-Code Testing
   Here, we have compiled a simple c-code to find sum of n numbers to test the gcc compiler.
   And leafpad is a text editor that i have used.
